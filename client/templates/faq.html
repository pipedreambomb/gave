  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
  
  <h3>What is Giving Counts?</h3>
  <p>Giving Counts is a free, open-source web application to help serial philanthropists and general do-gooders track their charitable donations and get feedback about the impact they're making.</p>

  <h3>Is Giving Counts for me?</h3>
  <p>As explained on the <a target="_blank" href='/'>home page</a>:
  <blockquote>
	<p>Since Giving Counts is just as much about effects as it is giving, at time of launch (21st April 2013) we only allow tracking of donations to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities">top charities recommended by GiveWell.org</a>. If you give to these charities, welcome aboard!</p>
	<p>The reason for this current restriction is that we incorporate the information GiveWell publishes after painstaking analysis into what returns can be expected from each dollar given to an organization. This is also the first version of the site, and we are launching early and depending on your feedback to shape its future, so let us know if this or anything else matters to you.</p>
	<p>In time, we hope to allow you to add your own causes so you can track all your donations here. You will have the option for these to be published for other users, if you can provide sufficient evidence of their efficacy.</p>

  <h3>What's the big idea?</h3>
  The big idea is that giving a good proportion of one's income to some stellar charities can have an incredible impact. I was very impressed by the book <a target="_blank" href="http://thelifeyoucansave.org">The Life You Can Save by Peter Singer</a>, having heard about it in a <a target="_blank" href="http://developmentdrums.org/484">Development Drums podcast episode</a> with Toby Ord of <a target="_blank" href="http://givingwhatwecan.org">givingwhatwecan.org</a>.</p>
  <p>I am currently starting my own software business and have almost no income, but I'd love to help facilitate more and better giving in the community. It's pretty impressive that though Giving What We Can is not a well known organization, they have already marshalled $120,000,000 of past and future pledges. If I can add a couple of percentage points to that by making it more fun and rewarding, I'll make a bigger difference than all the money I'll ever earn would!</p>

  <h3>If Giving Counts is open source, where is the code?</h3>
  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pipedreambomb/gave">It's on GitHub</a>, of course! Any help would be tremendously helpful, especially with design of the site as I am more of a developer than a designer. It's written with the <a target="_blank" href="http://meteor.com">Meteor framework</a> for JavaScript and runs on <a target="_blank" href="http://nodejs.com">NodeJS</a>, so unfortunately you'll need to be at least vaguely familiar at least with the latter (similar to myself!) to get it running on your machine.</p>

  <h3>How is Giving Counts funded?</h3>
  <p>It isn't! <a target="_blank" href="http://meteor.com">Meteor.com</a> are very kindly hosting the site for free. The site is developed by volunteers (currently only one, but he would love some help, see previous question!).</p>

  <h3>I still have questions...</h3>
  <p>Please, use the feedback form on the right side of the page, honestly and often. I will try to get back to you quickly, if you ask me to. This is currently very much work-in-progress, and you know better than I do how it can grow and improve. If you hate forms and love email, you can send me one at <a target="_blank" href="mailto:g@georgenixon.co.uk">g@georgenixon.co.uk</a> as well.</p>
