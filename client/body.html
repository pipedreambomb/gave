	<p>In particular, the site does not work at all with Internet Explorer 7, 6 or lower. This is due to the modern technology used in Giving Counts. 99% of internet users no longer use these browsers, and they are difficult to support and limit functionality. Please do yourself a favour and upgrade your browser! If you can't because of external factors, you could at least <a href="http://www.google.com/chromeframe">try Chrome Frame</a> for your current browser.
